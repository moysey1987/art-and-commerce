                "Design is equal parts art and commerce... Design seeks to create experiences in addition to being profitable, so the price and profit of the work represent only part of its value. I think the most fitting way to think about the best works of design are
                as gifts."

                <h3>Let's start at the beginning</h3>

                <p>Art and Commerce is (currently) a one-person design and development studio (hi, I'm Nigel). I've been working in user experience and content strategy for over 10 years, helping companies like Officeworks, Metricon Homes, Crown Hotels,
                    The Movember Foundation and many others reach, delight, and sell to their audiences. I'm currently the User Experience Lead at Tundra in Fitzroy, one of Melbourne's best digital studios.
                </p>
                <p> I started Art + Commerce after a year studying visual design and development online after work during the coronavirus pandemic. If you want the whole story... I started Art + Commerce after finishing Frank Chimero's <a href="http://shapeofdesignbook.com/"
                        target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="fancy-link">'The Shape of
                    Design'</a> in an evening over a bottle of red.</p>
                <p>I've always held a keen interest in the theory and granular detail of design, as well as the fascinating contradiction of coding's strict precision and endless flexibility. Frank's words seemed to be the tipping point to something that
                    had been bubbling up inside me for a long time. That and the confidence I'd gained while taking a truly obscene number of <a href="http://www.superhi.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="fancy-link">SuperHi</a> courses throughout
                    the year.</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, after conquering the fundamentals during the dumpster fire of a year that was 2020, I figured the best way to continue learning, to further develop my skills (and maybe to start earning a little extra pocket money) was to open up the My First Side
                    Hustle® play set and start a business. Inspired by the transparency and helpfulness of <a href="http://www.hawraf.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="fancy-link">HAWRAF</a> and many others like them, I
                    plan to run this business in the open, publishing the lessons I learn as I experience them.
                </p>
                <p>So, here we are. This is going to be fun.</p>

            <div class="about-column-two">
                <h4>What does Art and Commerce do?</h4>
                <p>Firstly, if you need a small website (think creative portfolios, campaign pages, event microsites, a small business website like this one) and you're conscious of your budget, then I'm your person. Having an agency background in UX and
                    content means I won't just design and build something for you, I'll design and build the <b>right</b> thing, and you won't have to pay multiple people for it.</p>
                <p>Secondly, thirdly, fourthly... you can utilise my skills in UX, content, design, development, or even project management on their own, to help you bring your project to life in any way I can.</p>
                <p>Finally, I should mention what I <b>can't</b> build at the moment, and that's CMS driven websites like Wordpress sites (where you're able to manage and update the content on your own once it's handed over to you) or eCommerce sites like
                    Shopify. I'll be taking on those types of jobs in late 2021 after some more study. In the meantime, if you need UX, design or content for a website like that, I can still help ;)</p>
                <h4>How do we get started then?</h4>
                <p>That one's easy, keep scrolling and fill in the form below. Even if you're not sure what you want or need at the moment, I'd be glad to help you figure it out, so don't be afraid. I'm not going to spam you with newsletters because I don't
                    have time to write one. If you haven't taken on a web project before, I know it can be a little tricky to understand where to begin, so let me give you a hand and we can figure out if Art + Commerce is the right fit for you together.</p>
