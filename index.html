                    <p>Our sites are responsive, accessible, search engine optimised and performant. In fact, this website performs so well in Google's "lighthouse" website testing platform that the browser shoots confetti.</p>
                    <p>Our tight integration of UX, Design and Development means that we're constantly fiddling with the finer details and interactions, because we know that it's in those details that your audience will find the greatest joy (whether they're

                            <p>We develop small, simple, no fuss static websites using HTML, CSS and Javascript. No CMS (coming soon), no eCommerce (also coming soon) and no hassle (available now!).
                            </p>
                            <p>Our sites are responsive, accessible, search engine optimised and performant. In fact, this website performs so well in Google's "lighthouse" website testing platform that the browser shoots confetti.</p>
                            <p>Our tight integration of UX, Design and Development means that we're constantly fiddling with the finer details and interactions, because we know that it's in those details that your audience will find the greatest joy (whether
                                they're aware of it or not).</p>

                "Design is equal parts art and commerce... Design seeks to create experiences in addition to being profitable, so the price and profit of the work represent only part of its value. I think the most fitting way to think about the best works of design are
                as gifts."

            </p>


            <div class="about-column-one">

                <h3>Let's start from the beginning</h3>

                <p>Art and Commerce is (currently) a one-person design and development studio (g'day, I'm Nigel). I've been working in user experience and content strategy for over 10 years, helping companies like Officeworks, Metricon Homes, Crown Hotels,
                    The Movember Foundation and many others reach, delight, and sell to their audiences. I'm currently the User Experience Lead at Tundra in Fitzroy, one of Melbourne's best digital studios.
                </p>
                <p>After studying design and development for a year (in an attempt to stop myself from going crazy during the coronavirus pandemic) I started Art and Commerce. The exact moment I started it, if you want the whole story, was immediately after
                    finishing Frank Chimero's <a href="http://shapeofdesignbook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="fancy-link">'The Shape of
                    Design'</a> in an evening over a bottle of red.</p>
                <p>I'd always loved the theory and creative expression of design, as well as the fascinating contradiction of coding's strict precision and endless flexibility. Frank's words that night seemed to be the tipping point that pushed me over the
                    edge. That, and the confidence I'd gained from <a href="http://www.superhi.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="fancy-link">SuperHi's</a> courses and community throughout the year.</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, after conquering the fundamentals during that dumpster fire of a year, I decided that the best way forward was to open up the My First Side Hustle® playset and start a small business. Inspired by the transparency and helpfulness of
                    <a href="http://www.hawraf.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" class="fancy-link">HAWRAF</a> and many others like them, I plan to run this business in the open, publishing the lessons I learn as I experience them.
                </p>
                <p>So, here we are. This is going to be fun.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="about-column-two">
                <h4>Art + Commerce specialise in small static websites</h4>
                <p>Think creative portfolios, social media campaign landing pages, event or festival microsites, band websites, or a small business website just like this one. If you need something along those lines, we're the studio for you. We won't just
                    design and build any old website, we'll take the time to properly understand your goals so we design and build the <b>right</b> website — and you won't have to pay us with your first-born and a six-pack for it like you will with a
                    large agency.
                </p>
                <p>You can also utilise our skills in UX, content, design, development, or project management on their own, to help you bring your project to life in any way we can. So if you've already got a developer but need some design, or already have
                    a design but need some content, we can still help.</p>
                <p>Finally, a note on what we <b>can't</b> develop just yet, and that's predominantly CMS-driven websites like Wordpress sites (where you're able to manage and update site content on your own once it's handed over to you) or eCommerce websites
                    like Shopify. We'll be expanding our practise to take these types of jobs on in late 2021, so do keep an eye out.</p>
                <h4>We understand it can be tricky to know where to begin</h4>
                <p>If you haven't taken on a web project before, it can be a little tricky and overwhelming to understand where to begin. So, even if you're not sure what you need or don't know if we're the right fit, we'd still be glad to help you figure
                    it out. So don't be afraid, and fill in our <a href="#contact" class="fancy-link">contact form</a>. We're not going to spam you with newsletters because we don't have time to write one.</p>
